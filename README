mod_gridfactory is an Apache-2 module for creating a GridFactory
web service for job pulling.

The module should be used together with mod_dbd, mod_ssl, mod_gacl.
With these four modules and the GridFactory daemons you will have
a GridFactory server with database authorization done via GACL.

Large parts of the code are taken from the book
"The Apache Modules Book".

In order to build the source you must have development libraries of
Apache-2 installed. Moreover, these and the mod_dbd of your Apache
installation must have MySQL support.
A simple Makefile is provided for building a DSO module.
To build on a UNIX-like system, type 'make'.

To install the module either type 'make install' or simply copy
".libs/mod_gridfactory.so" to your Apache modules directory.
A sample Apache configuration file is provided ("grid.conf").
You may want to copy this to your virtual hosts directory - and
modify it to suit your Apache setup.
