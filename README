mod_gridfactory is an Apache-2 module for creating a GridFactory
web service for job pulling.

The module should be used together with mod_dbd, mod_ssl, mod_gacl.
With these four modules and the GridFactory daemons you will have
a GridFactory server with database authorization done via GACL.

Large parts of the code are taken from the book
"The Apache Modules Book".

In order to build the source you must have development libraries of
Apache-2 installed - and these and the mod_dbd of your Apache
installation must have MySQL support. Moreover, you must have the
development libraries of MySQL installed.

Specifically, you must have versions of libaprutil-1.so and
mod_dbd.so with MySQL support. Older distros don't have this
because of licensing issues. To build these libraries, please see

http://www.holwegner.com/article/448/fixing-debian-etchs-broken-apache-mod_dbd

After making sure these prerequisites are ok, you can build
mod_gridfactory.so using the simple Makefile provided.
To build on a UNIX-like system, type 'make'.

To install the module either type 'make install' or simply copy
".libs/mod_gridfactory.so" to your Apache modules directory.
A sample Apache configuration file is provided ("grid.conf").
You may want to copy this to your virtual hosts directory - and
modify it to suit your Apache setup. If you've installed GridFactory
files and directories in their default locations, you should only need
to change the DBDParams, ServerName, ErrorLog and CustomLog directives.
