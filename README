mod_gacl is an Apache-2 module for authentication and authorization via
X.509 certificates.

The module should be used together with mod_dav and mod_ssl. With these
three modules you will have a file server with directory permissions set
via GACL.

The module is an extension of the module mod_auth_script, written by
Shigeru Kanemoto <sgk@ppona.com>, Accense Technology Inc.
(http://accense.com/).

The GACL code is taken from the gridsite code (http://www.gridsite.org/),
of Andrew McNab, University of Manchester.

In order to build the source you must have development libraries of
libxml2 and Apache-2 installed.
A simple Makefile is provided for building a DSO module.
To build on a UNIX-like system, type 'make'.

To install the module either type 'make install' or simply copy
".libs/mod_gacl.so" to your Apache modules directory.
A sample Apache configuration file is provided ("grid.conf").
You may want to copy this to your virtual hosts directory - and
modify it to suit your Apache setup.
You should also copy the sample VO script ("mk_vo.sh") to the
location specified in the Apache configuration (/usr/local/bin).
